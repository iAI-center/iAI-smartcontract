## Key Features

### 1. **Data Management**
- **On-Chain:**
  - Provides immutable storage for transactions and key records, ensuring data integrity and transparency.
- **Off-Chain:**
  - Enables real-time processing of AI models and large data sets, facilitating computationally intensive tasks.

### 2. **Smart Contracts**
- Automates rules and processes on-chain, including:
  - Access control.
  - Payments and other decentralized financial operations.
- Triggers off-chain operations via APIs for:
  - Complex computations.
  - AI inference tasks.

### 3. **AI Model Updates**
- **Off-Chain:**
  - AI models are trained locally or within federated setups to leverage high-performance computing resources.
- **On-Chain:**
  - Aggregated model updates are securely stored for verification, ensuring consistency and auditability.

### 4. **Security and Privacy**
- **On-Chain:**
  - Guarantees data integrity and access control using blockchain's inherent security features.
- **Off-Chain:**
  - Handles sensitive data privately to protect user confidentiality and reduce storage costs.

### Workflow
1. Transactions and key records are stored immutably on-chain.
2. Smart contracts enforce rules and trigger off-chain APIs for real-time AI operations.
3. AI model updates are aggregated off-chain and securely recorded on-chain for verification.
4. Sensitive data is processed off-chain to ensure privacy and efficiency.
